Bitcoin Price Forecasting Project

Overview:
This project focuses on forecasting Bitcoin prices using time series analysis techniques. Leveraging historical price data and advanced forecasting models, the aim is to provide insights into future price trends.

Setup:
1. Clone the repository: git clone <repository_url>
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:
1. Run main.py: python main.py
2. Explore the analysis results and visualizations.

Graph Explanation:
The graph generated by the project visualizes the performance of different models during cross-validation, with the Y-axis representing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the X-axis representing the Fold.

1. Y-Axis (Mean Absolute Error):
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE) measures the average magnitude of errors between predicted values and actual values.
   - Y-axis values represent the average absolute errors calculated for each model across different folds of cross-validation.
   - Lower MAE indicates better model performance, indicating that the model's predictions are closer to the actual values.

2. X-Axis (Fold):
   - The X-axis represents the folds used in cross-validation.
   - Each fold is used once as a validation set while the remaining folds form the training set.
   - X-axis values indicate the specific fold being evaluated, ranging from 1 to the total number of folds.

Interpreting the Graph:
- Each line on the graph corresponds to a different forecasting model (e.g., Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA).
- The plot shows how the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) varies across different folds of cross-validation for each model.
- Lower values on the Y-axis indicate better model performance, meaning the model's predictions are closer to the actual values.
- By comparing the MAE values of different models across folds, you can assess which model performs better on average and whether there are consistent patterns in performance across different folds.
