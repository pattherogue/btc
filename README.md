Bitcoin Price Forecasting Project

Introduction:
This project aims to demonstrate advanced proficiency in time series analysis and forecasting techniques applied to Bitcoin price data. By leveraging state-of-the-art methodologies and rigorous evaluation frameworks, the project showcases the application of sophisticated data science methodologies in real-world financial data analysis.

Project Overview:
The Bitcoin Price Forecasting Project encompasses several key components:
1. Data Retrieval: Historical Bitcoin price data is obtained from the CoinGecko API.
2. Data Preprocessing: The fetched data is meticulously cleaned and structured to prepare it for analysis.
3. Model Selection and Evaluation: Various time series forecasting models, including Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA, are explored and evaluated for their efficacy in predicting Bitcoin prices.
4. Performance Visualization: Evaluation results are visually depicted to facilitate comprehensive analysis and interpretation.

Setup:
1. Clone the repository: git clone <repository_url>
2. Install the required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:
1. Run the main.py script: python main.py
2. The script orchestrates the entire data analysis pipeline, from data retrieval to model evaluation, providing insightful results and visualizations.
